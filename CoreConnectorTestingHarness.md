# Core Connector Testing Harness

The core connector testing harness has got step-by-step instruction as to how it can be downloaded and used.

[**Github Repository for Core Connector Testing Harness**](https://github.com/infitx-org/cbs-core-connector-test-harness)

## Testing Harness Intended Use
The testing harness is intended to be used for:
1. Learning the integration APIs
2. Developing core-connectors 
3. Running the golden path Core-Connector test collection to validate that the core-connector meets the integration requirements of the scheme.

## Customizations to test collection
The testing harness meets a standard generic implementation.
It may be necessary to customize the test collection in order to adjust for non-standard APIs. The standard collection includes all required fields, so this adjustment may just be a mere reorganization of the message payload.
