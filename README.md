# Introduction 
The goal of this SI toolkit is to give System Integrators, Digital Financial Service providers, Hub operators, any policy stakeholders and any concerned parties a central location for all information regarding connecting to a Mojaloop scheme. This documentation provides both policy and technical integration information to answer most if not all questions around what it takes to integrate to a Mojaloop Scheme.


# What is Mojaloop
Mojaloop is an open-source software platform designed to help financial institutions, mobile network operators, and fintech companies create interoperable digital payment systems. It was originally developed by the Mojaloop Foundation, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and its goal is to advance financial inclusion by enabling low-cost, real-time payment services, especially in underbanked and unbanked regions.

Key features of Mojaloop include:

- Interoperability: Mojaloop allows different financial service providers, including banks, mobile wallets, and payment processors, to connect and interact with each other seamlessly.

- Real-time payments: It facilitates immediate payments between participants in the system.

- Open-source: The platform's code is freely available, making it adaptable to various local contexts and reducing the cost of building payment infrastructure.

- DFSP inclusion: The platform supports digital financial service providers (DFSPs), making it easier for more people to access formal financial services, particularly in developing economies.

Mojaloop is often seen as a framework to build national or regional payment infrastructures, which can improve the financial ecosystem's efficiency and drive down transaction costs.
