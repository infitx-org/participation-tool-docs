To help API implementation efforts, DFSPs are provided with:</p><ul><li>the specification of the Mojaloop Connector API</li><li>a Core Connector template</li></ul><p>What is a Core Connector template? DFSP Core Backends have their own custom API or enterprise integration solutions so multiple variants of Core Connector have been built to align with common Core Banking Solution (CBS) products. These Core Connector variants are all built using a standard template.

The key resources of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API are the party lookup, quotes, and transfers services:</p><ul><li><strong>Party lookup service:</strong> Identifying the DFSP serving the Payee and the Payee itself (= the recipient of funds in a transaction) based on a Payee identifier (typically a MSISDN, that is, a mobile number).</li><li><strong>Quotes service:</strong> Requesting a quote and exchanging cryptographic proof to prepare and secure the transfer. A quote is a contract between a Payer DFSP and Payee DFSP for a particular financial transaction before the transaction is performed. It guarantees the agreement set by the Payer and Payee DFSPs about the Payer, the Payee, and transfer amount, and is valid during the lifetime of a quote and transfer of a specified financial transaction.</li><li><strong>Transfers service:</strong> Executing the transaction as per the agreed details and cryptographic proof.</li></ul><p>Within the context of the Mojaloop FSPIOP API, the transfer happens in three main steps corresponding to these three phases:</p><ul><li>Identifying the Payee (party lookup or discovery phase)</li><li>Agreeing the transfer (quote or agreement phase)</li><li>Executing the transfer (transfer phase)</li></ul><p>Using Mojaloop Connector and the Mojaloop Connector API, the DFSP has the choice to perform the transfer process in one combined step, in two steps, or three steps.</p><p>For more information on the three phases of a transfer in Mojaloop, see Module 2: Mojaloop in greater detail of <a href="https://mojaloop.io/mojaloop-training-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mojaloop training course</a> DFSP-101.</p><h2 id="design-documentation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-documentation"><span>Design Documentation</span></a></h2>',14)),r("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("It best practice to design integrations using sequence diagrams.
