This section contains documentation on recommendations and to-dos on the different financial operations that should happen on be put in place for successful operation of an integration. It contains information about the accounting schema, prefunded liquidity design and any other information that is relevant to the financial operations team of a DFSP.


## DFSP Liquidity Design
All transactions that move through a Mojaloop payment gateway are prefunded. This removes systemic risk and allows the settlement of cleared funds between financial institutions to be fast and reliable.

Designing for liquidity for a DFSP must therefore cover both the mechanisms and procedures for managing the liquidity but also the controlling of exposure. [Learn more](/md-docs/LiquidityDesign.md)
