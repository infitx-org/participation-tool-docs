# PM4ML Documentation Guide

## Objective
This document provides a comprehensive overview of several key processes: setting up a development environment for a Core Connector, deploying a Payment Manager using Docker Compose, configuring custom core connectors, and securing the Docker Daemon.
 
---


### 1: Core Connector Setup

The "CoreConnectorSetup.md" file details the configuration and deployment of a Core Connector, a crucial middleware component that facilitates communication between a DFSP's Core Banking System and the Mojaloop platform.
#### **Key Concepts:**
- It explains the Core Connector's roles, including transaction processing and routing, API transformation, security and compliance, error handling, and performance optimization.

#### **Development Environment Setup:**
- The document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a development environment, covering prerequisites like installing necessary tools (Docker, Node.js, TypeScript, Git), configuring environment variables, and running the Core Connector

### 2: Deploying Docker Compose Payment Manager

The "DeployingDockerComposePayment.md" file focuses on deploying a Payment Manager using Docker Compose, streamlining its integration with the Mojaloop system for secure payment processing.
#### **Deployment Process:**
- It outlines the prerequisites, including minimum machine requirements and software dependencies (Docker, Docker Compose).

#### **Installation and Configuration:**
- The document provides detailed instructions for installing Docker and Docker Compose on both Ubuntu/Linux and Windows systems. It also covers cloning the Payment Manager repository, building and running containers, managing deployments, and optional steps for remote server deployment.

#### **Best Practices:**
- The guide emphasizes the importance of using environment variables for secure configuration.

### 3: Configuring a Custom Core Connector

The "ConfiguringACustomCoreConnector.md" file guides users through the process of replacing a mock backend ("sim-backend") with a real DFSP implementation (Core Connector) within the Mojaloop environment. It also details how to create custom configurations for managing shared and DFSP-specific environment variables and integrate them into docker-compose.yml.
#### **Key Actions:**
- Replacing the sim-backend, creating shared environment blocks for common variables (like FSP_ID and CONNECTOR_NAME), and customizing DFSP-specific configurations.

#### **Objective:**
- Streamlining the configuration and deployment of core connectors for different institutions (MNOs, Banks) within the Mojaloop ecosystem.

### 4: Securing the Docker Daemon

The "SecuringTheDockerDaemon.md" file provides essential security best practices for protecting the Docker Daemon and containerized applications.
#### **Security Measures:**
- It covers enabling TLS for secure communication, restricting Docker API access, implementing user access control, limiting container privileges, configuring Seccomp and AppArmor profiles, enabling logging and monitoring, keeping Docker updated, restricting container networking, scanning images for vulnerabilities, and enabling resource limits.

#### **Goal:**
- To harden the Docker environment against unauthorized access and potential security threats.



```

In summary, these documents provide a holistic guide to setting up and deploying Core Connectors and Payment Managers while emphasizing security best practices in a Dockerized environment.
